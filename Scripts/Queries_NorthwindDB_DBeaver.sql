#40 Ordersâ€”accidental double-entry details, derived table
#Here's another way of getting the same results as in the previous problem,
# using a derived table instead of a CTE. 
#However, there's a bug in this SQL. It returns 20 rows instead of 16. Correct the SQL.
#Fixed SQL: (add distinct to the Select statement nested in the JOIN statement

#39 Orders = accidental double entry details
#Based on the previous question, 
#we now want to show details of the order, 
#for orders that match the above criteria.

#Slyvia's Answer using CTEs:

    Select
OrderID

Group By OrderID, Quantity 
Having Count(*) > 1

    ,Discount
From OrderDetails
Where
    OrderID in (Select OrderID from PotentialDuplicates)
Order by
    OrderID
    ,Quantity;

#How would you change the answer from 32 to the problem above?
#Answer: The key is to only group by CustomerID and Company Name. A given company could have different OrderID's.
#Therefore, by emitting the OrderID from grouping we allow for all orders to be aggegated per CompanyName/CustomerID.
