# SQL_Queries_NorthwindDB_DBeaver
In order to really understand how to use SQL, I knew a learn by doing approach as opposed to video learning would be ideal. A couple google searches later and boom,
I discovered Sylvia Moestl Vasilik's course: 

SQL Practice Problems: 57 beginning, intermediate, and advanced challenges for you to solve using a “learn-by-doing” approach (MySQL version)
and
More SQL Practice Problems 40 intermediate and advanced challenges for you to solve using a “learn-by-doing” approach (MySQL version)

At the time of writing this (4/21/2021) I am on question 45. I certify that all problem solving has followed the steps below and the few times I have resorted to looking at Sylvia's answer is because I already spent over 45 minutes trying to write said query.

My problem solving strategy is as follows:
1. Conceptualize the problem relative to the database and keywords that connect different tables together. 
2. Identify the functionality I am trying to utilize in my own words (mentally), and find MySQL keywords that match said function. 
3. Review use cases of different MySQL keywords online. 
4. Review previous problems to understand what I know and revist the current problem to identify the "missing piece of the puzzle".
5. Write queries, run queries, error --> understand errors and simplify the query into subqueries. 
6. Write queries, run queries, error --> more trial and error. 
7. Take a step back, rethink strtegy and repeat steps.
